// Description:
// Area of an arrow
// An arrow is formed in a rectangle with sides a and b by joining the bottom corners to the midpoint of the top edge and the centre of the rectangle.

// a and b are integers and > 0

// Write a function which returns the area of the arrow.

// My solution:
const arrowArea = (a, b) => (0.5 * a) * (0.5 * b)
