// Description:
// Write a function that will take in any array and reverse it.

// Sounds simple doesn't it?

// NOTES:

// Array should be reversed in place! (no need to return it)
// Usual builtins have been deactivated. Don't count on them.
// You'll have to do it fast enough, so think about performances

// My solution:
const reverse = arr => {
    for (let i = 0; i <= Math.floor((arr.length - 1) / 2); i++) {
        let el = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - 1 - i];
        arr[arr.length - 1 - i] = el;
    }
    return arr;
}
